### 1.5 Where does a GRC Analyst Fit in the Cybersecurity Picture?

**A Symphony sounds lovely when all the pieces are playing their part.**
An effective cybersecurity program has many moving parts and GRC is but one. This lecture will outline where in the big picture GRC fits and how it interrelates with other functions.

**You get an Audit! You get an Audit! You get an Audit!**

Wonderful!
 You should now have an understanding of both what an audit is what 
regulations, frameworks, or programs you would likely be auditing. Well
 done!

Based on what you have at this point you could start sniffing around for GRC analyst 'audit' work. Just saying'

### 2.8 Resume Bullet Unlocked

## 4. Cybersecurity Risk Work

### 4.1 Introduction

**Is Risk Risky?**

Risk is the core function of the GRC analyst. Businesses cannot invest 
in every technology and protect from every threat, so where to invest 
and where to commit resources is the role of the risk analyst to figure 
out. Lets dig in.

**Module Objectives**

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Explain what information security risk is

- Name multiple resources for gathering threat intelligence

- Apply threat intelligence to qualifying information security risk

- Analyze information security risk based on vulnerabilities, threats, and exploitation potential

- Summarize how information security risk is calculated

## 5. Information Security Governance Work

### 5.1 Introduction

**What's the G in GRC?**

Governance is an abstract concept that can't be technically practiced. It is the tone of the company and often set by senior leadership. What is acceptable and what will not be tolerated is documented in policy and enforced by management. This will inherently reflect the attitude of leadership and define an orgs governance.

> # Resume: A menu where you're the entree
> I interviewed Joe Hudson, a long time Cybersecurity recruiter about cyber resumes and what employers are looking for. Instead of making content about resumes, this interview really has immense value. The video can be accessed here: [https://youtu.be/5T_u7l-t56g](https://youtu.be/5T_u7l-t56g)
> 
> Also, (as seen in the interview), Joe provided 3 resume templates that are excellent. They are added as attachments to this lecture (below) or can be accessed via [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PucaJJSXhwW7DEX6YeGaCX_xIXXAZcHR/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PucaJJSXhwW7DEX6YeGaCX_xIXXAZcHR/view?usp=sharing)
